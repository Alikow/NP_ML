# NP_ML
## Introduction
Classical machine learning algorithms with pure python numpy.

And a tool to help you understand the root of all the classical algorithms instead of blindly using tools like sklearn or tensorflow.

## Algorithm list
### Classical ML
- Perceptron
- KNN
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- AdaBoost
- HMM
### NLP
- LDA
### Time Series Analysis
- AR
## Reference
All classical ML algorithms was validated by example in [*Statistical Learning Method*(《统计学习方法》)](https://www.amazon.com/%E7%BB%9F%E8%AE%A1%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%EF%BC%88%E7%BB%9F%E8%AE%A1%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95-%E7%BB%9F%E8%AE%A1%E8%87%AA%E7%84%B6%E8%AF%AD%E8%A8%80%E5%A4%84%E7%90%86-%E7%AC%AC2%E7%89%88-%E5%85%B12%E6%9C%AC%E5%A5%97%E8%A3%85%EF%BC%89-Chinese-ebook/dp/B01M8KB8FF/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1521303280&sr=8-1&keywords=%E7%BB%9F%E8%AE%A1%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95)
